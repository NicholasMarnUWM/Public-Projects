Hello! This is a side project I started in June of 2022 as something to take my mind of my thesis-- a Hearts of Iron 2: Darkest Hour Scenario that
explores the events of the "Business Plot" during the FDR administration and presents a chilling counterfactual-- specifically, what if they had succeeded? 

This scenario was primarily inspired by Sinclair Lewis's "It Can't Happen Here", along with Oliver Stone's "The Untold History of the United States", with additional
historical flavor and ideas provided by Jonathan M. Katz's "Gangsters of Capitalism" and Sally Denton's "The Plots Against the President". 

Please note that this is a work of fiction, and additionally, an immense amount of this code is NOT my own work. This mod is heavily derived from the Hearts of Iron 2: Darkest Hour
mods and as such, the work here should be credited to Paradox Entertainment and the Darkest Hour modding community. 

Changelog:

6/27/2022: Adding in tutorial & AI from Darkest Hour Full to begin testing the build environment.
